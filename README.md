# Prework Study Guide
## Description

I created this project to provide a place for bootcamp students to store their notes in an organised and easily accessible way. It ensures students can keep track of the large amounts of information they are provided on the course and can easily refer back to it whenever necessary. During the process of building this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I now understand that HTML provides the building blocks of any webpage or application, CSS allows the dev to style this content and Javascript enables the user to interact with the content in a meaningful way.
